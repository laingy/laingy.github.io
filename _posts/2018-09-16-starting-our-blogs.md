    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I tried to include what I had learnt in year 7 when completing this task. Because I had alot of homework this week I left my IT until that weekend, on reflection I should have done it on Monday or earlier in the week when I would have remembered how to do the styles as they didn't work.</td>
